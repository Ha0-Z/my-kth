Squantial logic vs combination logic
Squantial local: output is depending on previous input
combination: output depends only on input

Why the wire can not connect back in combination logic without sequantial logic in the middle?
Because it creates isolation behaviour.

What is the essence of digital systems?
Concurrency: It is concurrenctly excuting, every component not wait other components, it responds to the input all time.
Continues time: each component are always giving input.

How to step by step calcuate digital logic? 
1: break connection between processes
2: Execute each process with it present inputs
3: transfer output of node to it next process input
repeat 1,2,3 till nothing get new changes


==weightage== is (b is the most significant, m is the length of the sequance), - b * 2 ^m
