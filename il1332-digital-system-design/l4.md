# Lecture 4

Generalization: Is making the delay of a modul become a funciton?

Critical path: The path where it takes longest time.

Multi level logic: For example a ripple carry chain where to get sum10 you need to go through from adder 1 to 9.


## Powerpoint 4 
### Carry Look Ahead Adder
Example:
f   = za
    = (y+b)a
    = (c(d+e) + b)a
    = ab + acd + ace
    = ~(~(ab) ~(acd) ~(ace) )
