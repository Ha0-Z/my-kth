## Powerpoint 1
Overflow detect method 1:
Check the sign bit of operand A, operand B and Sum, if the sign bit is both positive or negative on A, B or Sum is not 0.

Overflow detect method 2:
Check the first two sign bit of the sum, if is 01 overflow, it if 10 underflow, same  like 11 or 00 is not overflow.

How to avoid over/underflow?
1. Allocate one extra bit in operands.
2. Sign extend operands.
3. Do the addition.

Overflow mitigation saturation is if it overflows, then the result stays to the max positive or negative number.


## Powerpoint 2
Half Adder
Operand bits A and B in 1bit, Sum in in two bit.
